# ⏰ Blog Generation Interval Changed to 24 Hours - COMPLETED ✅

## 📋 What Was Changed

Your blog generator has been successfully updated to generate blog posts every **24 hours** instead of every 10 minutes.

## ✅ Files Updated

### 1. **main.py**
- Changed startup scheduler interval from `10` to `1440` minutes
- Updated standalone mode scheduler interval to 24 hours
- Enhanced logging to show "generating posts every 24 hours"

### 2. **src/scheduler.py**
- Updated default `interval_minutes` parameter from `10` to `1440`
- Added smart interval display (shows hours for intervals ≥ 1440 minutes)
- Improved logging to display both hours and minutes for large intervals

### 3. **demo.py**
- Updated documentation to reflect "every 24 hours" instead of "every 10 minutes"
- Changed API example to use `1440` minutes in scheduler start command

## 🎯 New Behavior

### Before:
```
Blog generation: Every 10 minutes
Daily posts: ~144 posts per day
```

### After:
```
Blog generation: Every 24 hours (1440 minutes)
Daily posts: 1 post per day
```

## ⚙️ Technical Details

- **Interval**: 1440 minutes = 24 hours = 1 day
- **Scheduler Type**: APScheduler with IntervalTrigger
- **Default Setting**: All new instances will use 24-hour intervals
- **API Override**: Can still be changed via `/scheduler/start` endpoint

## 🧪 Verification Results

```
✅ Default interval: 1440 minutes (24 hours)
✅ Interval display: "24 hours (1440 minutes)"
✅ All references updated consistently
✅ PM2 service configuration updated
```

## 🚀 Current Status

- ✅ **Configuration**: Updated to 24-hour intervals
- ✅ **PM2 Service**: Restarted with new settings
- ✅ **Documentation**: Updated to reflect changes
- ⚠️ **Database**: Connection issue detected (separate from interval change)

## 📅 Expected Behavior

Your blog generator will now:
1. **Generate one blog post every 24 hours**
2. **Randomly select** between GenAI and Blockchain themes
3. **Assign proper tags** based on content theme
4. **Maintain all other functionality** (stats, cleanup, manual triggers)

## 🔧 Manual Override

If you need to change the interval later, you can use:

```bash
# Via API (example: 12 hours = 720 minutes)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/scheduler/start" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"interval_minutes": 720}'

# Or restart PM2 after modifying the code
pm2 restart blog-generator-api
```

## 🎉 Summary

**Your blog generator now operates on a daily schedule!** 

Instead of generating 144+ posts per day, it will now create **one high-quality blog post every 24 hours**, making it much more manageable and sustainable for your blog content strategy. 📚✨
