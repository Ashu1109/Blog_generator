### 5. **Updated API Endpoints**
- New `theme` parameter in blog generation requests

  - Custom topic + theme: `{"topic": "DeFi innovations", "theme": "blockchain"}`

## üöÄ How to Use

### Automatic (Scheduler)
The scheduler now automatically generates blogs with random themes every 10 minutes.

### Manual API Calls

# Random theme (GenAI or Blockchain)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/generate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'

# Specific Blockchain theme
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/generate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"theme": "blockchain"}'

# Custom topic with theme
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/generate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"topic": "DeFi protocols", "theme": "blockchain"}'
```

### Testing
```bash
# Test theme functionality
python3 test_blockchain_theme.py

# Full demo with both themes
python3 demo.py --full
```

## üìä Statistics

- **Total Topics Available**: 40
  - GenAI Topics: 20
  - Blockchain Topics: 20
